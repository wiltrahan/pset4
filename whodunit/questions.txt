1. stdint.h is a header file that introduces several new integer types
   that keep sizes standard across all systems.

2. These are exact-width integer types which are guaranteed to have the same
   number N of bits across all implementations.

3. BYTE = 1 BYTE
   DWORD = 4 BYTES
   LONG = 4 BYTES
   WORD = 2 BYTES

4. BM

5. biSize is a fixed number bytes required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER.
   bfSize is the size of the whole file incl the header file.

6. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and
   its origin is the upper-left corner.

7. biBitCount

8. because you did not get a legitimate pointer back from fopen()

9. because it will only read 1 BITMAPFILEHEADER

10. 3
11. sets file position
12. It is a constant that moves the file pointer position to given location.
